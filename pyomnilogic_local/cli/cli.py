    """OmniLogic Local Control - Command line interface for Hayward pool controllers.

    This CLI provides local control and monitoring of Hayward OmniLogic and OmniHub
    pool controllers using their local UDP API (typically on port 10444).

    The CLI connects to your pool controller when you run a command and caches
    configuration and telemetry data for use by that command.

    Examples:
        # Connect to controller at default address
        omnilogic get lights

        # Connect to specific controller IP
        omnilogic --host 192.168.1.100 debug get-telemetry

        # Get raw XML responses for debugging
        omnilogic debug --raw get-mspconfig
